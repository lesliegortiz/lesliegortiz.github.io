    <p>
      Hello! My name is Leslie Ortiz, and I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island.
      <br>
      I love web design and have had quite a bit of experience when it comes to creating webpages. I've won gold in the state round for the web design category of SkillsUSA an afterwards went on to receive 17th nationally. 
      <br>
      I'm always looking to improve on my skills, I know that they are far from perfect. I'm very excited to learn everything that I can within these computer science courses as my passion is instilled heavily within coding.
