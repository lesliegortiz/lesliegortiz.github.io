  <h1>Applications Page</h1>
    
    <p>
      Welcome to my Applications page page. As modern technology continues to evolve, humans rely on applications now more than ever. Applications have made a huge impact on us thanks to their efficiency and simplicity in use.
      <br>
      According to searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com "An application can be self-contained or a group of programs. The program is a set of operations that runs the application for the user. Examples of applications include word processors, database programs, web browsers, development tools, image editors and communication platforms."
