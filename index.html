  <h1>Welcome To Leslie's Programming Portfolio</h1>
    
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Leslie Ortiz, and I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island. 
      <br>
      This assignment was given to me through CSC 106, a computer science course meant to introduce the joy of programming.
      This website is an early product of my digital portfolio, it'll get increasingly more intricate as the course goes on. 
      <br>
      The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase programs assigned to my peers and I where we will put our knowledge of web languages to the test.    
    </p>
    
    <p>
      As you progress through this webpage you'll notice a few key aspects. First there's a picture banner which provides the name of the course.
      <br>
      Next there's four buttons, they'll lead you to the Home, JavaScripts, Applications or an About Me page.
      <br>
      You'll also notice format aspects such as a large title and a paragraph providing a description underneath it.
      <br>
      Thank you for visiting my page.
